                  <p>The Consumer Act of the Philippines (RA7394) provides consumers the right to seek Repair, Replacement, and 
                    Refund as relief in case a consumer product is found to be defective or has an imperfection. In case of <b>Repair</b>, 
                    work must conform to the <b>express warranty within 30 days </b>which may be extended by agreement, while <b>Replacement</b> 
                    may be elected when the product continues to have a defect or malfunction after a reasonable number of attempts 
                    to remedy the problem. If Replacement is not possible, a <b>Refund</b> is allowed but the amount attributable to the 
                    use of the consumer prior to the discovery of non-conformity shall be deducted. These remedies are available at no 
                    cost to you as the consumer. </p>

                  <p>If the product is covered by an <b>express warranty</b> review the terms and conditions provided therein
                    so you may be guided.
                    Should there be no express warranty, the seller, distributor, and/or manufacturer is responsible for
                    <b>implied warranty</b> against defects which shall endure for not less than
                    sixty (60) days nor more than one year following the sale of new consumer products.</p>

                  <p>Should there be no action on the part of the establishment and you wish to pursue a complaint,
                    you may file the same by registering at and providing the required details on our consumer
                    complaints website at <a href="https://consumercare.dti.gov.ph/#/home">https://consumercare.dti.gov.ph/#/home</a></p>

                <div class="answer-paragraph-hide" id="warraty1-ques2-ans">
                  <p>Express warranties are written promises by the seller to the quality of the product. These express warranties specify what the 
                    seller’s obligations are in case the product fails and how long a warranty is valid for.

                    If no warranty card or certificate was handed to you upon purchase, then there is an implied warranty that protects your 
                    rights as a consumer to seek repair, replacement, and refund within sixty (60) days to one (1) year. In this case, the receipt 
                    acts as the warranty card.</p>

                <div class="answer-paragraph-hide" id="warraty1-ques3-ans">
                  <p>Generally, there is no implied warranty in the sale of secondhand articles. Second-hand products do not carry 
                    any guarantee and cannot be returned or replaced if they turn out to be defective. The seller or vendor is only 
                    liable in the sale of a secondhand product if the seller provides an express written warranty to warrant the general 
                    fitness or quality of the product sold to the buyer. Thus, we advise that you revisit the terms and conditions of 
                    your contract and check if there is any express written warranty provided therein. </p>

                  <p>According to the Consumer Act, consumers have the right to have the product repaired, replaced,
                    or refunded if the purchased product is defective or damaged. Also, Repairs must be made within 30
                    days, but this can be extended if agreed upon. </p>

                    warranty, no warranty card,
                    there is an implied warranty against hidden defects. This will be no less than 60 days and no more
