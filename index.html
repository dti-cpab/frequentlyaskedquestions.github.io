                  <p><b>The Consumer Act of the Philippines (RA7394)</b> provides consumers the right to seek Repair,
                    Replacement, and
                    Refund as relief in case a consumer product is found to be defective or has an imperfection. In case
                    of <b>Repair</b>,
                    work must conform to the <b>express warranty within 30 days </b>which may be extended by agreement,
                    while <b>Replacement</b>
                    may be elected when the product continues to have a defect or malfunction after a reasonable number
                    of attempts
                    to remedy the problem. If Replacement is not possible, a <b>Refund</b> is allowed but the amount
                    attributable to the
                    use of the consumer prior to the discovery of non-conformity shall be deducted. These remedies are
                    available at no
                    cost to you as the consumer. </p>

                  <p>If the product is covered by an <b>express warranty</b> review the terms and conditions provided
                    therein
                    so you may be guided.
                    Should there be no express warranty, the seller, distributor, and/or manufacturer is responsible for
                    <b>implied warranty</b> against defects which shall endure for not less than
                    sixty (60) days nor more than one year following the sale of new consumer products.
                  </p>

                  <p>Should there be no action on the part of the establishment and you wish to pursue a complaint,
                    you may file the same by registering at and providing the required details on our consumer

                <div class="answer-paragraph-hide" id="warraty1-ques2-ans">
                  <p><b>Express warranties</b> are written promises by the seller to the quality of the product. These express
                    warranties specify what the
                    seller’s obligations are in case the product fails and how long a warranty is valid for.

                    If no warranty card or certificate was handed to you upon purchase, then there is an implied
                    warranty that protects your
                    rights <b> as a consumer to seek repair, replacement, and refund within sixty (60) days to one (1) year.</b>
                    In this case, the receipt
                    acts as the warranty card.</p>

                  <p>Generally, there is no implied warranty in the sale of secondhand articles. Second-hand products do
                    not carry
                    any guarantee and cannot be returned or replaced if they turn out to be defective. The seller or
                    vendor is only
                    liable in the sale of a secondhand product if the seller provides an express written warranty to
                    warrant the general
                    fitness or quality of the product sold to the buyer. Thus, we advise that you revisit the terms and
                    conditions of
                    your contract and check if there is any express written warranty provided therein. </p>

                <div class="answer-paragraph-hide" id="pricefreeze-ques1-ans">
                  <p> Republic Act (RA) No. 7581 or what we call the Price Act states that a price freeze is
                    automatically implemented in
                    areas that have been declared under a state of emergency, calamity, disaster, rebellion, or war,
                    or that have been placed under martial law, or that have been suspended what we call the privilege
                    of writ of habeas corpus.
                    Note, the DTI does not declare a price freeze. </p>

                  the price freeze in effect?</h4>
                <div class="answer-paragraph-hide" id="pricefreeze-ques2-ans">
                  <p> The price freeze is in effect for a maximum of 60 days for products that are considered basic
                    necessities and 15 days for household LPG and liquid fuel.
                    It may be shortened if the conditions that led to the implementation of the price freeze are lifted
                    earlier.
                    It may also lifted if the President of the Philippines lifts it.</p>

                  <p>The price freeze covers products that fall under the category of “basic necessities.”
                    This means that stores cannot increase the prices of “basic necessities” such as sardines, milk,
                    coffee, instant noodles,
                    bread, candles, salt, including rice, pork, chicken and beef, fish, vegetables under the
                    jurisdiction of the
                    Department of Agriculture, and essential medicines as prescribed by the Department of Health.</p>
